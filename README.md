This thesis deals with the construction of a Fullstack web application that aims to provide a personalized meal finder, utilizing the power of machine learning and NLP.  
This application combines modern Frontend and Backend technologies to provide a complete user experience. 
It includes login and registration pages to manage users, as well as a main page to search for recipes through a user-friendly interface. 
One of the main features of this app is the integration of natural language understanding (NLP) techniques through the use of Hugging face's pre-trained t5-recipe-generator model. 
This model, which has been trained on over 2 million recipes, allows the recipe search to be customized based on the user's needs and preferences.
The conclusion of the thesis is the ease of using machine learning in web applications to enhance system functions for a better user experience.
